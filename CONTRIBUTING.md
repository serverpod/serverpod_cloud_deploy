# How to contribute

This tool is maintained by Serverpod and is built by the community for the community.
We welcome contributions from everyone, regardless of your experience level.
This document will guide you through the process of contributing to the cli_tools packages.

## Ways to contribute

There are multiple ways to contribute. Here are some of the most common ways:

- **Code**: Contribute code and fixes.
- **Documentation**: Contribute to the documentation.
- **Support**: Help others get started or expand their use.
- **File issues**: Suggest new features or improvements.

## Roadmap

If you are considering contributing code, please check the existing issues to see if your contribution is addressed by them, in whole or in part.

## Contributing code

Pull requests are very much welcome. If you are working on something more significant than just a smaller bug fix, please declare your interest on an issue first. This way we can discuss the changes to ensure that they align with the project's goals and prevent duplicated work.

### Submitting a pull request

All pull requests should be submitted to the `main` branch. The pull request should contain a description of the changes and a reference to the issue that the pull request is addressing.

All code changes should come with tests that validate the changes. If the changes are not testable, please explain why in the pull request.

To keep the projects git history clean, we will squash PRs before merging. Therefore, it is essential that each pull request only contains a single feature or bug fix. Keeping pull requests small also makes it easier to review the changes which in turn speeds up the review process.

Before the Serverpod team can review your pull request, it must pass the CI checks. If the CI checks fail, the pull request will not be reviewed.

## Contributing support

We encourage you to support others using these packages by sharing your knowledge and experiences. You can help by participating in conversations on filed issues, or contributing your insights through tutorials and blog posts.

## Contributing with issues

Help us make this tool better by filing [issue](https://github.com/serverpod/serverpod_cloud_deploy/issues/new) for bugs, feature requests, or improvements. When filing an issue, please provide as much information as possible to help us understand the problem or suggestion.
